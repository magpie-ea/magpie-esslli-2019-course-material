To do this, we will use our first example frome before, on the interpretation of “confidence intervals”, which you can clone from here.

The results of all this customization are also in the customization_exercises branch in the repository linked above. 8.1 Changing the CSS styles Make the picture of Prof. Bumbledorf smaller, by overwriting the default CSS in file 01_custom_styles.css. 8.2 Customize the post-survey enquette Create a custom view for the post-survey screen that includes an additional question, e.g., “Have you taken this survey before?” with a dropdown menu with options “yes”, “no” and “maybe”. Make sure that the data from this added field also shows up in the output in the final data table! 8.3 Add a short pause between trials Add a short 1 second pause between each main trial. 8.4 Add a response check Add a function (using a hook for after_response_enabled) to tell participants whether their answer was correct or not. life cycles &amp; hooks custom views "]
