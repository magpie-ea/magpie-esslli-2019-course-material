The questionaire was a single paper page that looked like this: The questionare used by Hoekstra et al (2014). 5.2.1 Getting started clone the “departure point” repository using git clone https://github.com/magpie-ea/magpie-departure-point rename the folder to a more fitting name and move to it download the required _magpie packages npm install update the information in the file README.md download this catchy photograph by professor Bumbledorf in action and place it in the images folder open the file 04_trials.js and replace the previous object trial_info with the following: const trial_info = { forced_choice: [ { question: &quot;Is the following statement a valid conclusion to draw from Prof. Bumbledorf&#39;s result, given the definition of a &#39;confidence interval&#39;?&quot;, QUD: &quot;Professor Bumbledorf conducts an experiment, analyzes the data, and reports:&quot;, picture: &quot;images/Prof-Bumbledorf.png&quot;, option1: &#39;yes&#39;, option2: &#39;no&#39;, correct: &#39;no&#39; } ] }; now, try out the experiment by opening the file index.html in the browser 5.2.2 Adding more content We now need to add the statements to be judged from the original paper, reproduced below: “The probability that the true mean is greater than 0 is at least 95%.”, “The probability that the true mean equals 0 is smaller than 5%.”, “The “null hypothesis” that the true mean equals 0 is likely to be incorrect.&quot;, “There is a 95 % probability that the true mean lies between 0.1 and 0.4.”, “We can be 95 % confident that the true mean lies between 0.1 and 0.4.”, “If we were to repeat the experiment over and over, then 95 % of the time the true mean falls between 0.1 and 0.4.” The problem is: where / how should we add these statements with the simple template that we are using? Ideally they should appear between the question and the repsonse buttons. Ideally, the statements should be highlighted, e.g., in bold. Can you think of a creative solution? (Hint: you can include HTML code in the strings given to fields like question etc.) The solution is in this footnote.1 Finally, also add an item number to each trial, i.e., consecutively number each question by inserting, for example item: 1 for the first question, item: 2 for the second, etc. 5.2.3 Adding another view The original paper also asked participants to rate their own statistical expertise on a scale from 1 (“no stats course taken”) to 10 (“teaching statistics at a university”). Let’s also add such a view before the questions about “confidence intervals” (because when not being able to answer the questions, participants might downgrade their self-assessed statistics expertise). We will use the template view for rating scales, which gives us a rating scale from 1 to 7, but that’s enough for our purposes here. open the file 05_views.js look at the documentation of the rating scale view and copy-paste the following code (at the end of the file): const statistical_expertise_rating = magpieViews.view_generator(&quot;rating_scale&quot;, { trials: 1, name: &#39;expertise_rating&#39;, data: [{ question: &quot;Please indicate your level of statistical experience from 1 (no stats course taken, no practical experience), to 7 (teaching statistics at a university)?&quot;, optionLeft: &#39;&#39;, optionRight: &#39;&#39; }] }); open the file 06_main.js and add the view in the right place in the view sequence, i.e., change it to: views_seq: [ intro, instructions, statistical_expertise_rating, forced_choice_2A, post_test, thanks, ] 5.2.4 More advanced customizing The rating scale view includes a lot of white space for a picture, but we do not have a picture right now. We can customize each view. See the docs for more information on customization. Here’s an example: change to view specification in 05_views.js to the following: const statistical_expertise_rating = magpieViews.view_generator(&quot;rating_scale&quot;, { trials: 1, name: &#39;expertise_rating&#39;, data: [{ question: &quot;Please indicate your level of statistical experience from 1 (no stats course taken, no practical experience), to 7 (teaching statistics at a university)?&quot;, optionLeft: &#39;&#39;, optionRight: &#39;&#39; }] }, { stimulus_container_generator: function(config, CT) { return `&lt;div class=&#39;magpie-view&#39;&gt; &lt;h1 class=&#39;magpie-view-title&#39;&gt;${config.title}&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p class=&#39;magpie-view-question magpie-view-qud&#39;&gt;${config.data[CT].QUD}&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;`; } }); 5.2.5 Finishing the job Though the basic functionality is there, the experiment is not polished yet. Add an appropriate welcoming message instructions, and a begin view between the expertise rating and the yes/no questions. A complete example of this experiment can also be found here. References "]
