Opportunities for suboptimality and failure abound. This course is all about avoiding pitfalls and cultivating a mindset aimed at continually improving practices. We will execute the whole process of implementation, preregistration, execution and data analysis during this course, based on a replication of a previous study. We do this using _magpie, an architecture to help realize browser-based experiments. This is the material for a course taught at ESSLLI 2019 (Riga, Latvia). "]
