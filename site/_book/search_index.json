Opportunities for suboptimality and failure abound. This course is all about avoiding pitfalls and cultivating a mindset aimed at continually improving practices. We will execute the whole process of implementation, execution and data analysis during this course, based on a replication of an existing experiment, which we will preregister. We do this using _magpie, an architecture to help realize browser-based experiments. This is the material for a course taught at ESSLLI 2019 (Riga, Latvia). Can I insert a reference to R Core Team (2016)? References "]
